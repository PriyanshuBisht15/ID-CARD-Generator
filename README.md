# QR-Code-Generator
A QR code generator is a tool or software that creates Quick Response (QR) codes, which are two-dimensional barcodes capable of storing various types of data. The generated QR code can encode text, URLs, contact details, Wi-Fi network information, or other data. Once generated, the QR code can be scanned by smartphones or other devices equipped with a camera and QR code reading software, which then decodes the stored information for the user.
